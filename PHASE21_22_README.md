}

for prop_id in framework.properties.keys():
    result = framework.runtime_monitor.check_property(prop_id, state)
    print(f"{prop_id}: {'✓' if result else '✗'}")

# Generate verification report
report = framework.generate_verification_report()
print(f"Verification coverage: {report['summary']['verification_coverage']:.1%}")

# Check exit criteria
exit_check = framework.check_phase21_exit_criteria()
print(f"All criteria met: {exit_check['all_criteria_met']}")
```
