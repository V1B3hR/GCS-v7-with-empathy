# Universal Ethical Laws for GCS-v7-with-empathy

## Introduction

These Universal Ethical Laws represent the fundamental moral principles that govern all actions and decisions within the GCS framework. They are considered inviolable and serve as the highest-level constraints that override all other considerations. These laws are derived from cross-cultural moral philosophies, human rights principles, and centuries of ethical thought, adapted specifically for the context of brain-computer interface technology.
