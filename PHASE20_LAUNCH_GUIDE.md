## Launch Execution

### Using the Launch Script

```bash
cd backend/gcs
python phase20_pilot_launch.py
```

This will:
1. Initialize the pilot management infrastructure
2. Create and configure all three pilot sites
3. Register IRB approvals
4. Validate readiness criteria
5. Generate launch status report

### Launch Validation (Dry Run)

To validate without executing:

```python
from phase20_pilot_launch import Phase20PilotLauncher

launcher = Phase20PilotLauncher()
summary = launcher.launch_q1_2026_pilot_sites(dry_run=True)
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd backend/gcs
python tests/test_phase20_pilot_launch.py
```

All 17 tests should pass, validating:
- Site creation for all contexts
- IRB approval configuration
- Infrastructure readiness
- Compliance validation
- Exit criteria achievement
