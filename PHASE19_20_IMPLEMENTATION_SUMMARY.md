3. Validate remaining exit criteria (accuracy ≥0.90, latency ≤45ms, energy ≤1.5x)
4. Production readiness review

### Phase 20 (3-6 months)
1. Complete IRB/ethics approvals for pilot sites
2. Finalize partner agreements (2-3 sites per context)
3. Deploy pilot infrastructure
4. Begin participant enrollment (target: 900-1500 total)
5. Initiate monitoring and longitudinal data collection
