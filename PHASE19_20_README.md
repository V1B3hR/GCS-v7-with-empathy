# Phase 19-20 Implementation Guide

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation of GCS Phases 19-20, which advance quantum processing capabilities and enable large-scale societal validation.

**Status:**

)
processor = QuantumEmotionProcessor(config)

# Process emotions
import numpy as np
features = np.random.randn(10, 8)  # 10 samples, 8 features
result = processor.quantum_process_emotions(features)

# Get predictions and metrics
predictions = result.predictions
confidence = result.confidence
metrics = processor.get_performance_metrics()
```
