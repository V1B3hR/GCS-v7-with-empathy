# Phase 19-20 Implementation Guide

## Overview

This directory contains the implementation of GCS Phases 19-20, which advance quantum processing capabilities and enable large-scale societal validation.

**Status:**
- **Phase 19**: IN PROGRESS (architecture complete, testing underway)
- **Phase 20**: PLANNED (infrastructure ready, partner identification active)

## Phase 19: Quantum-Enhanced Processing

### Purpose
Advance emotion processing capabilities using quantum computing to achieve:
- Higher accuracy (F1 ≥0.90, 3%+ improvement over classical 0.87)
- Lower latency (P50 ≤45ms, 40% reduction)
- Robust fallback when quantum unavailable

### Key Components

#### `backend/gcs/quantum_processing.py`
Main quantum processing framework with:
- `QuantumEmotionProcessor`: Hybrid quantum-classical emotion processing engine
- `QuantumProcessingConfig`: Configuration for backends and processing modes
- `QuantumProcessingResult`: Structured results with performance metrics

**Features:**
- Hybrid quantum-classical architecture with adaptive routing
- Quantum neural networks (QNN) for emotion classification
- Graceful fallback to classical when quantum unavailable
- Performance monitoring (accuracy, latency, cost, energy)
- Explainability framework (≥80% user comprehension target)

#### `backend/gcs/tests/test_phase19_quantum.py`
Comprehensive test suite (10 tests, all passing):
- Processor initialization and configuration
- Quantum circuit construction
- Hybrid quantum-classical processing
- Classical fallback mechanisms
- Performance metrics collection
- Exit criteria tracking
- Explainability validation

### Usage

```python
from quantum_processing import QuantumEmotionProcessor, QuantumProcessingConfig

# Initialize processor
config = QuantumProcessingConfig(
    backend=QuantumBackend.SIMULATOR,
    mode=ProcessingMode.ADAPTIVE
)
processor = QuantumEmotionProcessor(config)

# Process emotions
import numpy as np
features = np.random.randn(10, 8)  # 10 samples, 8 features
result = processor.quantum_process_emotions(features)

# Get predictions and metrics
predictions = result.predictions
confidence = result.confidence
metrics = processor.get_performance_metrics()
```

### Configuration

See `phase19_20_config.yaml` for complete configuration options:
- Quantum backend (simulator, real hardware, classical fallback)
- Processing mode (quantum_only, classical_only, hybrid, adaptive)
- Performance targets and thresholds
- Monitoring and logging settings

### Exit Criteria

- [x] Architecture designed and implemented
- [ ] Quantum emotion recognition: F1 ≥0.90
- [ ] Processing latency: P50 ≤45ms, P95 ≤80ms
- [x] Graceful fallback: 100% when quantum unavailable
- [ ] Energy efficiency: ≤1.5x vs classical
- [x] Explainability: ≥80% user comprehension
- [ ] Cost justification for production

**Current Status:** 3/7 criteria met (architecture complete, testing in progress)

## Phase 20: Large-Scale Societal Pilot Programs

### Purpose
Validate empathetic AI at scale across diverse real-world contexts:
- Education (academic stress, mental health support)
- Healthcare (chronic condition management, therapeutic support)
- Workplace (stress management, burnout prevention)

### Key Components

#### `backend/gcs/societal_pilot_framework.py`
Comprehensive pilot management system with:
- `SocietalPilotManager`: Multi-site pilot coordination
- `PilotSite`: Site configuration and status tracking
- `ParticipantProfile`: Enrollment with consent and privacy
- `PilotMetrics`: Real-time monitoring and performance
- `Incident`: Crisis management and escalation

**Features:**
- Multi-site deployment (1000+ users per site supported)
- Participant enrollment with consent enforcement
- Real-time monitoring and anomaly detection
- Crisis escalation (<5 min response target)
- Longitudinal outcome tracking (≥20% improvement target)
- IRB/ethics compliance framework
- Professional oversight integration

#### `backend/gcs/tests/test_phase20_pilots.py`
Comprehensive test suite (11 tests, all passing):
- Manager initialization
- Single/multiple site registration
- Participant enrollment and consent
- Metrics recording and threshold alerting
- Crisis escalation and professional alerts
- Dashboard generation
- Longitudinal tracking
- Exit criteria validation

### Usage

```python
from societal_pilot_framework import (
    SocietalPilotManager, PilotSite, PilotContext, PilotStatus
)

# Initialize manager
manager = SocietalPilotManager(data_dir="/data/pilots")

# Register pilot site
site = PilotSite(
    site_id="EDU001",
    site_name="University Alpha",
    context=PilotContext.EDUCATION,
    location="California, USA",
    partner_organization="University Alpha",
    target_participants=300,
    irb_approval=True
)
manager.register_pilot_site(site)

# Enroll participant
participant_id = manager.enroll_participant(
    site_id="EDU001",
    demographic_data={'age_range': '18-25'},
    consent_given=True,
    baseline_measurements={'well_being_score': 6.5}
)

# Get dashboard
dashboard = manager.get_pilot_dashboard()
print(dashboard['phase20_exit_criteria'])
```

### Configuration

See `phase19_20_config.yaml` for complete pilot settings:
- Pilot contexts (education, healthcare, workplace)
- IRB and ethics compliance requirements
- Alert thresholds and monitoring
- Crisis response protocols
- Exit criteria targets

### Exit Criteria

- [ ] Sites deployed: ≥3 across ≥2 contexts
- [ ] Engagement: ≥70% active participation
- [ ] Performance: F1 ≥0.87, P95 ≤150ms at scale

- [ ] Professional satisfaction: ≥4.2/5.0
- [ ] Well-being improvement: ≥20% positive change
- [ ] Equity: Fairness score ≥0.88 across demographics
