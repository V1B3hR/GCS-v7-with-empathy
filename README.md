An Empathetic, Co-Adaptive, and Therapeutic Brain-Computer Interface.

The Grand Council Sentient (GCS) is more than just a Brain-Computer Interface. It is a research initiative and a functional prototype for a system designed to be a true partner to the human mind. Our core philosophy is that the mind is like a flower: fragile, flexible, and requiring a supportive environment to thrive.
This project moves beyond simple command decoding. We are building a complete cognitive and affective interface that can sense intent, understand emotion, and is architected to safely and ethically act as a therapeutic agent. Our goal is to create a system that is not just powerful, but also embodies the principles of safety, privacy, and empathy.
  
  Core Features
The GCS is a full-stack, modular system built on a foundation of cutting-edge research and a safety-first design.

🧠 **The Neuro-Symbolic Core**: At its heart is a state-of-the-art, zero-shot BCI (GCS_v3.1-Production). It uses a Graph Attention Network (GAT) on an anatomical brain scaffold to decode motor intent with 86.5% validated accuracy on unseen users.

❤️ **The Empathy Progression Engine**: A complete five-stage empathy system that mirrors human emotional intelligence:
  - **Emotion Recognition**: Multi-modal fusion (EEG, HRV, GSR, voice) achieving F1 >0.87
  - **Emotion Understanding**: Contextual analysis with cultural adaptation and individual baselines
  - **Empathetic Reaction**: Therapeutic response generation (CBT, DBT, mindfulness)
  - **Advice & Guidance**: Evidence-based recommendations and skill-building support
  - **Issue Notification**: Advanced crisis detection with 6-level severity classification and emergency escalation

🛡️ **The Active Therapeutic Framework**: The GCS is architected for closed-loop therapeutic action. All potential interventions are governed by the AI_Guardian and a strict Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) consent protocol, ensuring the user is always in control.

🌱 **The Living Architecture**: The system is designed as a co-adaptive agent (Phase 10). It uses an Online Learning Module to learn from real-time user feedback, allowing it to continuously personalize and improve its understanding, creating a truly symbiotic partnership.
  
  System Architecture
The GCS is a full-stack application designed for modern, cloud-based development and deployment.
Frontend: A responsive and intuitive "Cognitive Dashboard" built with React and Three.js for 3D visualization.
Backend: A high-performance, asynchronous API server built with Python and FastAPI.
Real-Time Communication: A WebSocket bridge ensures low-latency data streaming from the backend to the frontend.
AI Core: Our complete GCS Python package, built with TensorFlow/Keras and Spektral, running as the intelligent engine within the backend.

  Getting Started
This repository is configured to run seamlessly in GitHub Codespaces, providing a powerful, pre-configured cloud development environment with a generous free tier.

1. Launch the Codespace:
Click the green <> Code button at the top of this repository.
Go to the "Codespaces" tab.
Click "Create codespace on main".
Wait for the environment to build automatically. This may take a few minutes.
2. Run the Application:
The Codespace will open a VS Code editor in your browser.
Two terminals are needed. You can open a new one by clicking the + in the terminal panel.
In the first terminal, start the backend:
code
Bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
In the second terminal, start the frontend:
code
Bash
npm run --prefix frontend start
The Codespace will automatically detect that you've started a web server and a pop-up will appear asking if you want to open it in a browser. Click "Open in Browser".
You are now running the full-stack GCS Cognitive Dashboard!
Project Structure
The repository is organized as a professional monorepo.

## Development Roadmap

The GCS development follows a comprehensive roadmap centered on creating truly empathetic AI through a clear progression: **Emotion Recognition → Understanding → Reaction → Advice → Issue Notification**.

🗺️ **[Detailed Roadmap](ROADMAP.md)** - Full project planning and phase mapping

### Empathy Vision: The Five-Stage Progression

Our empathy framework follows a natural, human-like progression of emotional intelligence:

1. **🎯 Emotion Recognition (COMPLETED)**: Multi-modal sensing of emotional states through EEG, heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, and voice analysis - achieving F1 >0.87 accuracy
   
2. **🧠 Emotion Understanding (COMPLETED)**: Deep contextual analysis considering individual baselines, cultural factors, personal history, and situational triggers
   
3. **❤️ Reaction Formulation (COMPLETED)**: Empathetic response generation with therapeutic interventions (CBT, DBT, mindfulness), personalized to individual preferences and cultural context
   
4. **💡 Advice & Guidance (COMPLETED)**: Evidence-based therapeutic recommendations, skill-building support, and well-being optimization strategies aligned with user goals
   
5. **🚨 Issue Notification (COMPLETED)**: Advanced crisis detection system with 6-level severity classification, automatic professional alerts, and emergency escalation protocols

### Current Focus: Advanced Empathy Integration (Phases 16-22)

**Completed Phases:**
- ✅ **Phase 16**: Brain-to-Brain Communication - Multi-user empathy and shared emotional awareness

# Run affective model training
python -m backend.gcs.training affective --config config.yaml

# Run both training modes sequentially
python -m backend.gcs.training both --config config.yaml
```

**Via main.py:**
```bash
cd backend
python main.py train-foundational --config ../config.yaml
python main.py train-affective --config ../config.yaml

## AI Ethics Framework

This project is governed by a comprehensive AI Ethics Framework that ensures bidirectional protection for both humans and AI systems. Our approach recognizes that ethical treatment must flow in both directions within the human-AI partnership.

### Core Documentation
- **[AI Ethics Framework](ethics/ai_ethics_framework.md)**: Comprehensive framework for ethical AI development and deployment
- **[Core Human-AI Principles](ethics/core_human_ai_principles.md)**: Ten foundational principles governing human-AI relationships
- **[Universal Ethical Laws](ethics/universal_ethical_laws.md)**: Fundamental moral constraints that override all other considerations
- **[Operational Safety Principles](ethics/operational_safety_principles.md)**: Practical implementation guidelines for ethical AI operation

### Our Foundational Principles
**Safety First**: The system is designed to be fail-safe. The AI_Guardian and conservative protocols are in place to prevent harm above all else.
**User Sovereignty**: The user is the ultimate authority. No action is ever taken without the user's explicit and informed consent. The system is a tool for empowerment, not control.
**Privacy by Design**: We are committed to protecting the most sensitive data imaginable. All models are trained with privacy-preserving techniques, and all data is handled with end-to-end encryption.
**Empathetic Action**: The system's core logic is being built to recognize and respond to the user's well-being. The goal is not just to execute tasks, but to foster a supportive and healthy cognitive environment.
**Bidirectional Respect**: We recognize that ethical treatment flows from humans to AI and from AI to humans, fostering true partnership.
