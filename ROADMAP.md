- Whitepaper v1
- Prototype module (lab sandbox only)
- Risk & misuse threat model (v1)

Exit Criteria:
- Latency <150ms round-trip aggregated
- Zero unauthorized relay events in controlled adversarial tests

Key Risks:
- Cross-contamination of unintended affective signals
- Identity spoofing (see Risk Register)

### Phase 17: Advanced Cognitive Augmentation (PLANNED)
Objectives:
- Adaptive cognitive load modulation guidance
- Memory scaffolding API (privacy-preserving embeddings)
Ethics:
- Transparent augmentation logging & explainability interface
Metrics:
- Cognitive task improvement ≤20% variance across demographic cohorts (fairness threshold)

### Phase 18: Collective Intelligence Framework Foundations (PLANNED)
Objectives:
- Group consensus protocol (verifiable aggregation)
- Bias attenuation layer (diversity-aware weighting)
Ethics:
- Collective consent & dissent representation model

## 10. Governance & Transparency
- Public Model & Ethics Cards auto-generated per release.
- Quarterly Transparency Report: incidents, mitigations, performance drift.
- External Advisory Review Cycle: every 2 quarters with published summary.
