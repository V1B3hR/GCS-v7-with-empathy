## 1. Vision Statement
The Grand Council Sentient (GCS) aims to become the world's first truly empathetic and ethically-grounded brain-computer interface system. Our vision centers on creating an AI system that not only understands the user's neural intent but also recognizes, understands, and responds to their emotional state with genuine empathy and therapeutic support.

### Vision Vibes: The Empathy Progression Journey

The GCS empathy framework follows a natural progression that mirrors human empathetic interaction:

| Code | Workstream | Core Focus | Sample KPIs |
|------|------------|-----------|-------------|
| WS-A | Ethics & Alignment | Dynamic principle adaptation | Ethical incident rate = 0 critical / quarter |
| WS-B | Privacy & Data Governance | Lineage, minimization, anonymization | Re-identification risk <0.05 |
| WS-C | Security & Adversarial Robustness | Red-teaming, spoofing defense | Spoof detection TPR >0.95 / FPR <0.05 |
| WS-D | Accessibility & Inclusion | Multi-lingual, neurodiversity support | Accessibility compliance ≥ WCAG 2.2 AA |
| WS-E | Regulatory & Clinical | QMS maturity, evidence packages | Submission readiness index >0.85 |
| WS-F | Sustainability & Efficiency | Energy, hardware optimization | Energy/inference ↓ year-over-year ≥15% |
| WS-G | Open Ecosystem & Community | Plugin APIs, dev governance | External contributions/month +30% |
| WS-H | Verification & Assurance | Formal specs, runtime monitors | Coverage of critical invariants ≥90% |

### 7.1 Assurance-in-Dev (Pulled Forward from Phase 21)
To build operating evidence early, we will deploy a minimum set of runtime monitors during Phases 16–18:
- Ethics constraint monitors (response safety and appropriateness)
- Latency SLAs on critical empathy paths (P95 <100ms where applicable)
- Crisis detection false-negative bound monitors with auto-escalation hooks
- Privacy/consent enforcement monitors with audit logging and alerts

Evidence artifacts will be attached under “Operating Evidence” in each relevant phase section.

## 9. Risk Management Enhancements
Adopts a scored register (appendix). Gating: Advancement to a new major phase requires: (a) No open Severity 1 risks; (b) Residual Severity 2 risk score aggregate < predefined threshold.

- Quarterly Transparency Report: incidents, mitigations, performance drift.
- External Advisory Review Cycle: every 2 quarters with published summary.

## 12. Conclusion
This update adds a clear, prioritized critical-path view and establishes early assurance monitoring so that ethical, empathetic, and technical guarantees grow together. It re-centers execution on the Vision’s empathy progression—sensing → understanding → reaction → advice → protective action—while making gaps explicit and testable, so we can ship empathy safely at individual, group, and societal scales.
