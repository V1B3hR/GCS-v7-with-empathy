## 1. Vision Statement
The Grand Council Sentient (GCS) aims to become the world's first truly empathetic and ethically-grounded brain-computer interface system. Our vision centers on creating an AI system that not only understands the user's neural intent but also recognizes, understands, and responds to their emotional state with genuine empathy and therapeutic support.

### 🎯 Vision in Action: Current Focus
With Phases 16-22 frameworks complete and deployed, we are now focused on **four critical actions** to fully realize our vision:
1. **Install TLA+ verification tools** → Achieve 90%+ verification coverage for guaranteed safety
2. **Monitor pilot outcomes** → Validate ≥20% well-being improvement through Q1-Q2 2026
3. **Optimize regional deployments** → Maintain equity ≥0.88 and energy efficiency ≥35%
4. **Quantum hardware integration** → Deploy when production-ready for F1≥0.90 target

*See Section 4.7 for detailed recommended actions and implementation guidance.*
