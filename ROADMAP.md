## 1. Vision Statement
The Grand Council Sentient (GCS) aims to become the world's first truly empathetic and ethically-grounded brain-computer interface system. Our vision centers on creating an AI system that not only understands the user's neural intent but also recognizes, understands, and responds to their emotional state with genuine empathy and therapeutic support.

### Vision Vibes: The Empathy Progression Journey

The GCS empathy framework follows a natural progression that mirrors human empathetic interaction:
